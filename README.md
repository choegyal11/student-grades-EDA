Student Performance Analysis using R
🧠 Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of student performance data using R. It aims to identify the key factors influencing academic success and provide data-driven insights that can assist educators, policymakers, and students themselves in fostering better educational outcomes.

📋 Project Objectives
Explore and preprocess student demographic and academic datasets.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships.

Visualize findings to better understand the impact of factors like study time, parental education, social habits, and health on academic results.

🗃️ Dataset Information
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Student Performance Data Set (or update based on your actual dataset)

Attributes Analyzed:

Demographic characteristics (age, gender, family structure)

Academic indicators (study time, failures, absences)

Social and lifestyle aspects (alcohol consumption, social outings, health status)

🛠️ Technologies and Tools
Programming Language: R

Libraries Used:

tidyverse (data manipulation and visualization)

ggplot2 (data visualization)

dplyr (data wrangling)

corrr (correlation analysis)

📈 Key Insights
Consistent study habits strongly correlate with improved academic performance.

Parental education levels show a moderate impact on student achievement.

Higher alcohol consumption is associated with lower academic scores.

Healthier lifestyle choices contribute positively to academic outcomes.
